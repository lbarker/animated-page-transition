Portfolio Template
=========
I combined two CodyHouse tutorials to create a fun portfolio template. 

#Animated Page Transition

A CSS powered animation, that replaces the refresh of the page while the content is updated using Ajax.

#Full-Screen Pushing Navigation

A full page menu, that replaces the current content by pushing it off the screen.
